I wanted a set of projects to do Thanksgiving week.  Always take that week off.  With the Pandamic I pick thingks to do that are not part of my normal routine.  Solder stuff.  That will be my Thanksgiving 2020 routine change. Was looking for things to solder and ran into a kit I've known about for years, The Mighty Ohm geiger counter kit, https://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/.

It has a serial out and I figured post the beta and gamma readings to APRS, http://aprs.org.  So another excuse to use a Raspberry Pi.
